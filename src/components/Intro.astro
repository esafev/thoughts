  <p>Software engineer focused on design, clarity, and the complexity behind simple things.</p>
  <p>Spent four years at <a target='_blank' href='https://readymag.com'>Readymag</a>[â†—] as a full-stack engineer, working across frontend, infrastructure, and product architecture. I care about well-made decisions, meaningful details, and tools that stay out of the way.</p>
  <p>Interests: AI, distributed systems, local-first software, early Apple, writing, philosophy, and computer history.</p>
