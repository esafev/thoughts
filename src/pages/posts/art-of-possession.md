This text is about my personal experience with maximalism, and minimalism, and how to deal with and live with it.

## The Path of Personal Possessions
### Maximalism: Embracing the Abundance
Until 2016, I was a guy who kept everything in the world that got into his hands. As an example, the packages of purchased items never went to the trash because my inner voice told me that they had a soul. Later, I began to associate this sentiment with a Japanese religion called [Shinto [神道]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinto), which approves of the above inner feeling.

### Minimalism: Embracing Simplicity
In 2016, I started decluttering my things and threw away all empty packages, zines, receipts, and other sh*t into the bin. Did it make me feel better? Yes and no, because throwing something away feels like throwing away a piece of your soul.

The next step, which continues today, was to sell everything that had some value. Since 2018, my local eBay account has ~180 closed lots, with prices starting at $1, and since then, it has come to be understood that we can sell anything in this world.

It would be nice to say my trust in _Shinto_ has gone away with this step, but conversely, there is an understanding that things must live, not lie on the shelf and scoop up dust.

At that time, I decided to never sell a lot of my lovely books, but in 2022, my migration to another country happened because of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and my inner voice told me to sell all this stuff and donate the revenue.

### The Present: Embracing Essentialism

It might seem like I've never bought anything since then, but it's not. Curiosity makes me buy some stuff from time to time, so adherence to the MPV-as-buying strategy to save some money. As an example, when a wish to buy anything comes to me, I try to find the cheapest analog or buy secondhand to test my interest.

I like owning things and watching them age, but I don't like to care for their safety too much. Again, things must live and work. I like to call it essentialism.

And also, the concept of things for the whole of life doesn't work because they tend to get boring.
Certain items of clothing defect, while others pledge their fealty anew.

## The Healthy Ownership
Extreme minimalism can serve as a [coping mechanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coping) during moments of overwhelming emotions. During mania, when I want to get rid of everything, I try to imagine what will happen if I achieve this, but the only thing that comes to mind is dying. It's a very unhealthy mindset to embrace.

In the end, I would like to say, don't block your wishes. Let yourself enjoy your own life. Perfectionism and minimalism can steal happiness.
