description: What I want what I get
---

There is a big chance that if you get this page you are looking for something to give me.\
I don't want too much, so here's my shortlist of wishes:

- [x] **Help me make this list**: Boredom has got to kill procrastinating;
- [ ] **Selfie from photobooth**: I'm looking for an old classic photobooth to take a photo, but I've failed. So, you will be my hero if you can provide me with the one;
- [ ] **Teeth cleaning**: Why not? I have never done this before;
- [ ] **Birthmark removal**: I'm a bald guy and I've been cutting my own hair for a long time, but I have a problem when I do it because I have a bunch of moles on my head that sometimes cause the injury, so it would be super cool if you could help me with that;
- [ ] **Hair clipper**: I've the old really cool Moser 1400 but I wanted to upgrade to the new one with Type-C and that have more compact format size, also it could give me really bald haircut;
- [ ] **Backpack/Helmetbag**: I'm dreaming of the ideal bag for me, I think I should make it myself because it's really hard to find the ideal one. I've had my lovely **Porter Yoshida Tanker Daypack** for a long time, but I want something minimalist with no extra pockets, it must have only one main pocket for my laptop and only one extra pocket for my wallet and keys, ideally it should be a helmet bag... There are so many dependable variables that I think it's really better to craft it myself;
- [ ] **Porsche 911 ride**: I'm a really big fan of cars, ... all cars, but 911 Porsche is my absolute favourite from my childhood, so I really want to feel this car on the drive wheel;
- [ ] [**Berkeley Mono Trial**](https://berkeleygraphics.com/typefaces/berkeley-mono): Developer Package.
- [ ] [**Dererk Jarman. Modern nature**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/195040.Modern_Nature): My personal holy bible, I had the one but in another language.

<br/>
_By the way, the list above almost includes physical items, so I would really appreciate it if you could get me something that would give me experience, like drumming lessons or tickets to the band._
