In September 2021, I bought my next Moleskine with the promise that I would regularly fill it with my thoughts.

In April this year, I realized that I had completely failed in that promise, as my notebook was only half-filled with infrequent notes. I tried to promise myself again, but with a clearer goal — to write at least three pages a day.

April ended with my notebook completely full, so I did it. I'm not sure, but I think it was the most connected time I've ever been with myself. I could connect my thoughts, reflect, and solve my inner problems only with blank paper and pen.

In May, I booked a real cabin on Airbnb without electricity, water, or other modern conveniences. But it had one crucial feature: a fireplace. I decided to read all my notes from the finished Moleskine, make a summary, and then burn it in the fireplace. It took me nearly six hours to summarize, transfer everything to digital, and then burn the physical notes.

The main reason I did this was my addiction to simplifying my life and embracing minimalism. So, I had the idea to perform this ritual and then make new notes only in the digital space.

I saw a lot of myself in the summary — how much I had grown and become a real adult. There were many heart-warming words about war, failed love, and relationships with myself and others. So many words to know...

So, I’ll just say one thing — take notes and re-read them often. There's a lot of the real you in there.

Today, I bought my new dotted Moleskine.
