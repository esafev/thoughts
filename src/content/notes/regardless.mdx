I started at 15 to make forums, blogs, etc. because I wanted to create a community and I wanted to have space for thinking. And this is my next attempt at creating an environment for thinking about engineering [of everything], life, and love.

_A special thanks to [Asko NÃµmm](https://ano.ee/), from whom I partially peeped the design for this site._
